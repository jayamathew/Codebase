# Getting Started

This is my personal repository which has a bunch of some of my (R/Python) code snippets for easy reference along with a list of reference websites which I enjoyed reading while learning some concepts. 

Some of this code was initially written while addressing customer issues on the [Azure ML forum]( 
https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/azure/en-US/home?forum=machinelearning).

Disclaimer: The code might need edits or have some errors that need to be addressed.
